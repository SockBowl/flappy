# Flappy bird clone


A while ago I built a lower functioning flappy bird clone using webgl for fun, but later realized that it did not run properly on all operating systems. Because of this I ultimately decided to re-build the game using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## Deployment

To deploy this project just run index.html in a browser locally. Also if available can use ide server.
